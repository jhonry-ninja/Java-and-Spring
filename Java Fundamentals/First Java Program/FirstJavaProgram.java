// First Java Program

/* In this assignment, you will create your own Java Program 
that will print your name, age, and hometown. Once you run your 
bytecode, you should see the following output: */
My name is Jhonry Opinaldo.
I am 100 years old.
My hometown is Milpitas, CA.

/* Objectives:

● In the main method, implement the code to print your name, 
  age, and hometown in different lines.
● Compile your code without errors.
● Run your .class file. */
